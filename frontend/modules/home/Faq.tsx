					<h3>What is Hello World?</h3>
					<p>

					<h3>What is a Hackathon?</h3>
					<p>
						A hackathon is not a place where people get together and try to break into
						websites. To us, hacking is when people come together to create awesome
						technical projects. People from all over the world will come together for
						Hackathons every few weeks, working together to make something amazing.
						Along the way there’s usually fun, food, and prizes.
